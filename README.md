# Php-SQL
This particular project is about an information system for a cinema webpage, where a visitor to the page can see the available movies. They can also request the creation of an account, which needs to be approved by an administrator first. The user of the page can also view the movies and book tickets for them by selecting the number of tickets and a showtime. The system administrator can add users, approve, edit, and delete users. They can also perform the same actions for movies, showtimes, and reservations. 

More specifically, it is about a Cinema website where the following actions can take place:
1) User Registration: A user can sign up, and after an admin reviews their request, they can log in to the page. Before that, they can only browse movies and view information about them.
2) System User Management: Once there are users and requests from users, the admin can access the admin.php page and manage these users. Specifically, they can a) approve requests for account creation, b) update user information, and c) delete a user.
3) Management of Structural Elements of the System: The admin has access to all the elements offered to users and created by them (reservations). Specifically, they can create and delete movies, create and delete screenings, and edit all of them.
4) Browsing Products: A regular user can view the movies available in the cinema without being logged in. They can also click on movies to get more information about them.
5) Product Reservation: A logged-in user, i.e., someone approved by the admin, can book tickets for a movie, creating a reservation for that movie. Additionally, the admin can view all reservations.







This system is implemented using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL
